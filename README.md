# Hey, Pane! ðŸ‘‹

Enlarge the active pane, either with a shortcut or with a super handy follow mode. Inspired by Origami for Sublime Text.

With _Hey, Pane!_ you can temporarily zoom/focus/enlarge (call it what you want) your active pane without losing sight of all other panes. The active pane get's really big, and all other panes will just peak around the corner. Perfect for focusing on your work or to make more space on a small screen.

If you want to see all your panes like they were before, just toggle _Hey, Pane!_ again and everything will be back to normal, like nothing happened. _Hey, Pane!_ temporarily saves all the sizes of your panes before focusing on one of them.

## Follow Mode

_Hey, Pane!_ can also follow your active pane and resize it, as soon as you change your Pane. Perfect for working with a small screen.

You can also use Follow Mode and manually toggling Focus, to get an overview of all active panes. It's a bit like magic<sup>\*</sup>. ðŸ’«


## TODOs

- [] Status Bar Indicator if Focus/Follow is active
- [] Add configuration for size of focused pane
- [] Darken minimized panes /w option
- [] Write tests


<sup>\*</sup> No real magic involved
